## <div align="center">About</div>
This repository is about the assignment from Research Project in Application of Artificial Intelligence on Medical Imaging 2022, NYCU. The purpose of this lab is to let us familiar with the flow of deep learning. Therefore, we are asked to classify the data which are published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The baseline is over 80% correct of our predictions during inference. We got 93.11% in final. The code is reference by Brandon O'Shea on Kaggle discussion.
